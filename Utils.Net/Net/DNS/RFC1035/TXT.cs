/// A TXT record can contain one or more character-string segments,
/// which can be combined into a single textual representation.
/// In practice, many DNS libraries and servers treat TXT data as either
/// a concatenated string or a list of separate segments.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// For example:
/// <code>
/// example.com.  3600  IN  TXT  "Some descriptive text here"
/// </code>
/// The <c>Text</c> property would hold the value <c>"Some descriptive text here"</c>.

/// treat this as a single text block. To conform to multi-segment usage, your library might need
/// additional logic for splitting or concatenating strings if required by a specific environment.
/// </para>
/// <para>The wire format is a sequence of character strings:</para>
