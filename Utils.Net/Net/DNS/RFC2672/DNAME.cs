/// <para>
/// The DNAME record is similar in purpose to a CNAME record, but whereas a CNAME
/// redirects a single alias to a canonical name, a DNAME record redirects an entire
/// subtree of the domain namespace. When a DNAME record is present for a name,
/// all queries for names in the subtree are mapped to a new domain name.

/// <para>
/// The RDATA of a DNAME record consists of a single <see cref="DNSDomainName"/>
/// which specifies the target domain for the redirection. For instance, if a DNAME record
/// is present for "foo.example.com" and its target is "bar.example.net", then a query for
/// "www.foo.example.com" would be redirected to "www.bar.example.net".
