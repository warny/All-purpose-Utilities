# Utils.Data Library

**Utils.Data** offers simple data mapping facilities.
It lets you populate objects from `IDataRecord` or `IDataReader` instances using attributes to describe the relationship between fields and properties.

## Features

- Attributes to map database columns to object properties
- Extension methods to fill objects directly from data readers
- Support for custom converters through interfaces
- Focus on separating mapping metadata from actual processing
