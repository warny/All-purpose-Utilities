# Utils.Mathematics Library

The **Utils.Mathematics** package offers advanced math helpers and generic algebra types used by other utilities.
It is built for extensibility so algorithms can operate on generic numeric types.

## Features

- Symbolic expression derivation and integration
- Fast Fourier Transform implementation
- Conversions to and from SI units
- Generic linear algebra structures (vectors and matrices in any dimension)
