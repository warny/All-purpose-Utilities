                            at the same owner.  Lower values are preferred.

                            act as a mail exchange for the owner name.

            KX records MUST cause type A additional section processing for the
            host specified by EXCHANGER.  In the event that the host processing
            the DNS transaction supports IPv6, KX records MUST also cause type
            AAAA additional section processing.
