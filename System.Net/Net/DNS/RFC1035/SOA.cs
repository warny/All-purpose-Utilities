        where:

        MNAME           The <domain-name> of the name server that was the
                        original or primary source of data for this zone.

        RNAME           A <domain-name> which specifies the mailbox of the
                        person responsible for this zone.

        SERIAL          The unsigned 32 bit version number of the original copy
                        of the zone.  Zone transfers preserve this value.  This
                        value wraps and should be compared using sequence space
                        arithmetic.

        REFRESH         A 32 bit time interval before the zone should be
                        refreshed.

        RETRY           A 32 bit time interval that should elapse before a
                        failed refresh should be retried.

        EXPIRE          A 32 bit time value that specifies the upper limit on
                        the time interval that can elapse before the zone is no
                        longer authoritative.

        MINIMUM         The unsigned 32 bit minimum TTL field that should be
                        exported with any RR from this zone.

        SOA records cause no additional section processing.

        All times are in units of seconds.

        Most of these fields are pertinent only for name server maintenance
        operations.  However, MINIMUM is used in all query operations that
        retrieve RRs from a zone.  Whenever a RR is sent in a response to a
        query, the TTL field is set to the maximum of the TTL field from the RR
        and the MINIMUM field in the appropriate SOA.  Thus MINIMUM is a lower
        bound on the TTL field for all RRs in a zone.  Note that this use of
        MINIMUM should occur when the RRs are copied into the response and not
        when the zone is loaded from a master file or via a zone transfer.  The
        reason for this provison is to allow future dynamic update facilities to
        change the SOA RR with known semantics.
