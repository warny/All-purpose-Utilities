        MADNAME         A <domain-name> which specifies a host which has a mail
                        agent for the domain which should be able to deliver
                        mail for the domain.

        MD records cause additional section processing which looks up an A type
        record corresponding to MADNAME.

        MD is obsolete.  See the definition of MX and [RFC-974] for details of
        the new scheme.  The recommended policy for dealing with MD RRs found in
        a master file is to reject them, or to convert them to MX RRs with a
        preference of 0.
