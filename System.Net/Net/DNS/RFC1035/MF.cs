            MADNAME         A <domain-name> which specifies a host which has a mail
                            agent for the domain which will accept mail for
                            forwarding to the domain.

            MF records cause additional section processing which looks up an A type
            record corresponding to MADNAME.

            MF is obsolete.  See the definition of MX and [RFC-974] for details ofw
            the new scheme.  The recommended policy for dealing with MD RRs found in
            a master file is to reject them, or to convert them to MX RRs with a
            preference of 10.
