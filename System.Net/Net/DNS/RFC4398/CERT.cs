	/// - <b>type</b>: The certificate type as defined in Section 2.1 of RFC 4398.
	/// - <b>key tag</b>: A 16-bit field computed for the key embedded in the certificate,
	///   using the RRSIG Key Tag algorithm described in Appendix B of [12]. It is used to
	///   efficiently select applicable CERT records for a particular key.
	/// - <b>algorithm</b>: The algorithm field has the same meaning as in DNSKEY and RRSIG RRs
	///   (e.g., RSA/MD5, DSA). A value of zero indicates that the algorithm is unknown to a secure DNS.
	/// - <b>certificate or CRL</b>: The remaining data is the certificate or CRL, stored in a
	///   format appropriate for the key in question. Prior to computing the key tag, the key MUST be
	///   transformed into the format it would have as the public key portion of a DNSKEY RR.
	///   If the key is not applicable to a recognized algorithm or does not meet size restrictions,
	///   the algorithm field MUST be zero and the key tag is meaningless.
