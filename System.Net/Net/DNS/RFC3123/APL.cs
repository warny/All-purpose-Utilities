              PREFIX            8 bit unsigned binary coded prefix length.

                                "!" character in the textual format.  It has
                                the value "1" if the "!" was given, "0" else.

           This document defines the AFDPARTs for address families 1 (IPv4) and
           2 (IPv6).  Future revisions may deal with additional address
           families.
