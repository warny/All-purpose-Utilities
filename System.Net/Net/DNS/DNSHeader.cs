    6. How to Resolve Securely and the AD and CD Bits

    Retrieving or resolving secure data from the Domain Name System (DNS)
    involves starting with one or more trusted public keys that have been
    staticly configured at the resolver.  With starting trusted keys, a
    resolver willing to perform cryptography can progress securely
    through the secure DNS structure to the zone of interest as described
    in Section 6.3. Such trusted public keys would normally be configured
    in a manner similar to that described in Section 6.2.  However, as a
    practical matter, a security aware resolver would still gain some
    confidence in the results it returns even if it was not configured
    with any keys but trusted what it got from a local well known server
    as if it were staticly configured.

    Data stored at a security aware server needs to be internally
    categorized as Authenticated, Pending, or Insecure. There is also a
    fourth transient state of Bad which indicates that all SIG checks
    have explicitly failed on the data. Such Bad data is not retained at
    a security aware server. Authenticated means that the data has a
    valid SIG under a KEY traceable via a chain of zero or more SIG and
    KEY RRs allowed by the resolvers policies to a KEY staticly
    configured at the resolver. Pending data has no authenticated SIGs
    and at least one additional SIG the resolver is still trying to
    authenticate.  Insecure data is data which it is known can never be
    either Authenticated or found Bad in the zone where it was found
    because it is in or has been reached via a unsecured zone or because
    it is unsigned glue address or delegation point NS data. Behavior in
    terms of control of and flagging based on such data labels is
    described in Section 6.1.

    The proper validation of signatures requires a reasonably secure
    shared opinion of the absolute time between resolvers and servers as
    described in Section 6.4.

    6.1 The AD and CD Header Bits

    Two previously unused bits are allocated out of the DNS
    query/response format header. The AD (authentic data) bit indicates
    in a response that all the data included in the answer and authority
    portion of the response has been authenticated by the server
    according to the policies of that server. The CD (checking disabled)
    bit indicates in a query that Pending (non-authenticated) data is
    acceptable to the resolver sending the query.
    These bits are allocated from the previously must-be-zero Z field as
    follows:

                                                1  1  1  1  1  1
                    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5
                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                |                      ID                       |
                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                |QR|   Opcode  |AA|TC|RD|RA| Z|AD|CD|   RCODE   |
                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                |                    QDCOUNT                    |
                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                |                    ANCOUNT                    |
                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                |                    NSCOUNT                    |
                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                |                    ARCOUNT                    |
                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

    These bits are zero in old servers and resolvers.  Thus the responses
    of old servers are not flagged as authenticated to security aware
    resolvers and queries from non-security aware resolvers do not assert
    the checking disabled bit and thus will be answered by security aware
    servers only with Authenticated or Insecure data. Security aware
    resolvers MUST NOT trust the AD bit unless they trust the server they
    are talking to and either have a secure path to it or use DNS
    transaction security.

    Any security aware resolver willing to do cryptography SHOULD assert
    the CD bit on all queries to permit it to impose its own policies and
    to reduce DNS latency time by allowing security aware servers to
    answer with Pending data.

    Security aware servers MUST NOT return Bad data.  For non-security
    aware resolvers or security aware resolvers requesting service by
    having the CD bit clear, security aware servers MUST return only
    Authenticated or Insecure data in the answer and authority sections
    with the AD bit set in the response. Security aware servers SHOULD
    return Pending data, with the AD bit clear in the response, to
    security aware resolvers requesting this service by asserting the CD
    bit in their request.  The AD bit MUST NOT be set on a response
    unless all of the RRs in the answer and authority sections of the
    response are either Authenticated or Insecure.  The AD bit does not
    cover the additional information section.

    6.2 Staticly Configured Keys

    The public key to authenticate a zone SHOULD be defined in local
    configuration files before that zone is loaded at the primary server
    so the zone can be authenticated.

    While it might seem logical for everyone to start with a public key
    associated with the root zone and staticly configure this in every
    resolver, this has problems.  The logistics of updating every DNS
    resolver in the world should this key ever change would be severe.
    Furthermore, many organizations will explicitly wish their "interior"
    DNS implementations to completely trust only their own DNS servers.
    Interior resolvers of such organizations can then go through the
    organization's zone servers to access data outside the organization's
    domain and need not be configured with keys above the organization's
    DNS apex.

    Host resolvers that are not part of a larger organization may be
    configured with a key for the domain of their local ISP whose
    recursive secure DNS caching server they use.

    6.3 Chaining Through The DNS

    Starting with one or more trusted keys for any zone, it should be
    possible to retrieve signed keys for that zone's subzones which have
    a key. A secure sub-zone is indicated by a KEY RR with non-null key
    information appearing with the NS RRs in the sub-zone and which may
    also be present in the parent.  These make it possible to descend
    within the tree of zones.

    6.3.1 Chaining Through KEYs

    In general, some RRset that you wish to validate in the secure DNS
    will be signed by one or more SIG RRs.  Each of these SIG RRs has a
    signer under whose name is stored the public KEY to use in
    authenticating the SIG.  Each of those KEYs will, generally, also be
    signed with a SIG.  And those SIGs will have signer names also
    referring to KEYs.  And so on. As a result, authentication leads to
    chains of alternating SIG and KEY RRs with the first SIG signing the
    original data whose authenticity is to be shown and the final KEY
    being some trusted key staticly configured at the resolver performing
    the authentication.

    In testing such a chain, the validity periods of the SIGs encountered
    must be intersected to determine the validity period of the
    authentication of the data, a purely algorithmic process. In
    addition, the validation of each SIG over the data with reference to
    a KEY must meet the objective cryptographic test implied by the
    cryptographic algorithm used (although even here the resolver may
    have policies as to trusted algorithms and key lengths).  Finally,
    the judgement that a SIG with a particular signer name can
    authenticate data (possibly a KEY RRset) with owner name Owner at the
    resolver is primarily a policy question.  Ultimately, this is a policy
    local to the resolver and any clients that depend on that resolver's
    decisions.  It is, however, recommended, that the policy below be
    adopted:

        Let A < B mean that A is a shorter domain name than B formed by
        dropping one or more whole labels from the left end of B, i.e.,
        A is a direct or indirect superdomain of B.  Let A = B mean that
        A and B are the same domain name (i.e., are identical after
        letter case canonicalization).  Let A > B mean that A is a
        longer domain name than B formed by adding one or more whole
        labels on the left end of B, i.e., A is a direct or indirect
        subdomain of B

        Let Static be the owner names of the set of staticly configured
        trusted keys at a resolver.

        Then Signer is a valid signer name for a SIG authenticating an
        RRset (possibly a KEY RRset) with owner name Owner at the
        resolver if any of the following three rules apply:

        (1) Owner > or = Signer (except that if Signer is root, Owner
        must be root or a top level domain name).  That is, Owner is the
        same as or a subdomain of Signer.

        (2) ( Owner < Signer ) and ( Signer > or = some Static ).  That
        is, Owner is a superdomain of Signer and Signer is staticly
        configured or a subdomain of a staticly configured key.

        (3) Signer = some Static.  That is, the signer is exactly some
        staticly configured key.

    Rule 1 is the rule for descending the DNS tree and includes a special
    prohibition on the root zone key due to the restriction that the root
    zone be only one label deep.  This is the most fundamental rule.

    Rule 2 is the rule for ascending the DNS tree from one or more
    staticly configured keys.  Rule 2 has no effect if only root zone
    keys are staticly configured.

    Rule 3 is a rule permitting direct cross certification.  Rule 3 has
    no effect if only root zone keys are staticly configured.

    Great care should be taken that the consequences have been fully
    considered before making any local policy adjustments to these rules
    (other than dispensing with rules 2 and 3 if only root zone keys are
    staticly configured).

    6.3.2 Conflicting Data

    It is possible that there will be multiple SIG-KEY chains that appear
    to authenticate conflicting RRset answers to the same query.  A
    resolver should choose only the most reliable answer to return and
    discard other data.  This choice of most reliable is a matter of
    local policy which could take into account differing trust in
    algorithms, key sizes, staticly configured keys, zones traversed,
    etc.  The technique given below is recommended for taking into
    account SIG-KEY chain length.

    A resolver should keep track of the number of successive secure zones
    traversed from a staticly configured key starting point to any secure
    zone it can reach.  In general, the lower such a distance number is,
    the greater the confidence in the data.  Staticly configured data
    should be given a distance number of zero.  If a query encounters
    different Authenticated data for the same query with different
    distance values, that with a larger value should be ignored unless
    some other local policy covers the case.

    A security conscious resolver should completely refuse to step from a
    secure zone into a unsecured zone unless the unsecured zone is
    certified to be non-secure by the presence of an authenticated KEY RR
    for the unsecured zone with the no-key type value.  Otherwise the
    resolver is getting bogus or spoofed data.

    If legitimate unsecured zones are encountered in traversing the DNS
    tree, then no zone can be trusted as secure that can be reached only
    via information from such non-secure zones. Since the unsecured zone
    data could have been spoofed, the "secure" zone reached via it could
    be counterfeit.  The "distance" to data in such zones or zones
    reached via such zones could be set to 256 or more as this exceeds
    the largest possible distance through secure zones in the DNS.

    6.4 Secure Time

    Coordinated interpretation of the time fields in SIG RRs requires
    that reasonably consistent time be available to the hosts
    implementing the DNS security extensions.

    A variety of time synchronization protocols exist including the
    Network Time Protocol (NTP [RFC 1305, 2030]).  If such protocols are
    used, they MUST be used securely so that time can not be spoofed.
    Otherwise, for example, a host could get its clock turned back and
    might then believe old SIG RRs, and the data they authenticate, which
    were valid but are no longer.
