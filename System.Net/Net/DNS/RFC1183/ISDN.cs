	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// According to RFC 1183, an ISDN record can contain:

	/// <item><description>The ISDN phone number, in a digit string.</description></item>
	/// <item><description>An optional subaddress.</description></item>
	/// </list>
	/// However, this class currently only stores a single <see cref="PhoneNumber"/> field,
	/// and does not parse or serialize a subaddress if present. Consequently, it may be
	/// incomplete for scenarios requiring a subaddress or more detailed data.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// In modern DNS usage, ISDN records are virtually never used, and the specification
	/// in RFC 1183 is largely historical. Consult the RFC if you need a more comprehensive
	/// representation (including subaddresses).

            RFC 1183 (Section 3.2) describes the ISDN RR format approximately as:

            ISDN RDATA format:

                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                /                 <ISDN-number>                /
                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                /               <subaddress> (optional)        /
                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

            Because subaddress is optional, some implementations store just the
            phone number. This class only supports a single string.
        */

		/// and optional subaddress), usage requiring a subaddress is not fully covered.
